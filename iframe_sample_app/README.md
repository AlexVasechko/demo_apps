# iFrame Sample App

This is the iFrame Sample App for the Zendesk App marketplace that is available at the nav_bar location. See [Manifest](http://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/apps/manifest.html) for more details about locations.

This app aims to be a good start to learn how send messages between an iframe and an app.

### The following information is displayed:

* A welcome message from the app with the agent's name
* A chat window which allows sending messages between the iFrame and the Zendesk App Framework SDK.

Please submit bug reports to [Zendesk](https://support.zendesk.com/requests/new). Pull requests are welcome.
