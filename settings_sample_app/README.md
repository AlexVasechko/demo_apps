# Settings Sample App

This App is designed to teach App developers about App settings.

Settings are completely optional with apps, but the value of them is strong, and they're very simple to set up and use.
The in-App settings page will be automatically generated, based on your configurations.

You should find in this App a few types of settings, which can be updated both via the new Zendesk interface and the Zendesk Apps API

### The following information is displayed:

* Default values
* Existing settings.
* Update app settings via curl command.
