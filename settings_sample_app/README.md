# Settings Sample App

This App is designed to teach App developers about App settings.

App settings are value that the Admin of the account can provide you on installation of the App. For instance, it could be a token to access your API,
the value of a field, a subdomain for your software or even a preference to customize the in-App experience.

Settings are completely optional with apps, but the value of them is strong, and they're very simple to set up and use.

You should find in this App a few types of settings, which can be updated both via the new Zendesk interface and the Zendesk Apps API

### The following information is displayed:

* Default values
* Existing settings.
* Update app settings via curl command.

Please submit bug reports to [Zendesk Support](support@zendesk.com). Pull requests are welcome.
