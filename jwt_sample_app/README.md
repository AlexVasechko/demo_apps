# JWT sample app

Zendesk apps support encoding information into JSON web tokens (JWT) and sending them in requests. JWT is a way of encoding and sending information in a HTTP request to be verified by a second party. 

### The following information is displayed:

The request response is logged to the developer console. The app is configured to use requestb.in to view the encoded message. This includes a setting for the requestb.in URI you will use for testing.

Please submit bug reports to the [issues page](https://github.com/zendesk/demo_apps/issues). Pull requests are welcome.
