# CommonJS sample app

The Zendesk App Framework now supports greater control of the structure
of your app, by introducing CommonJS module support. You can now define
as many modules as you like, placing them into the `./lib` directory. 

Please submit bug reports to the [issues page](https://github.com/zendesk/demo_apps/issues). Pull requests are welcome.
